Learning history will help students become more responsible to his life, to study and to his nation. When a student takes a history lesson, he will learn origin and consequences of conflicts in history, and then he will realize periods of darkness wake up as a human to stop it, he will realize moments where humanity shines and illustrat future and persue the pioneers as well. This is the process that helps a man to build his responsibility. I used to wasting my life on what is thought to be trivial matters now, and had conflict with my parents frequently just for simple reasons like to do or not to do homework. It took me a year to realize what I have done wrong, so much that it seems impossible for me tofix what had been deeply harmed during my adulescence. The only reason that I did not give up myself is my unexpected curiousity to history in my darkest times. I spend some time reading anecdotes in history at first. Then I started to devote myself in the splendid history of my country, China. I learned sacrifice and devotion of ancient great minds, who have become my beacon of life. Then I reached more recent hostory. I have to admit I was shocked by the determaination to rise up again of a country who had been fallen for long. "What should I do?" I asked myself, and the answer is clear and simple. I want to one of the backbones of my nation, and if i failed on it, I still want to be prepared for such honor. Learning history really changed my attitude towards life.
