The author of the article and speaker have a conflict of opinions about reason of the massive extinction at the end of Triassic period. The article put forward 3 hypotheses to explain the mass-extinction, which are all refuted by the following lecture.

Firstly, the passage suggest that the fluctuating sea levels in that period might be the reason for the massive scale extinction. The lecturer said that though the sea level once declined, coastal and shallow water ecosystem are able to adapt the change of sea levels. Because the sea level was declining in a slow pace, which took about a million years. It is clear only a sudden change of sea levels could had killed so much species before any of them adapt to the change. So that the lecturer thinks the mess-extinction is not caused by the decline of sea levels.

Second, the author propose that the volcanic activity are generally happening at the end of Triassic period and spread accountant SO2 into the atmosphere, which would make air temperature significantly decreased and simultaneously extinct species who can't adapt, while most of the species at that point can't. The speaker questioned the explanation by the evidence that SO2 in air will soon combine with water and fell back to earth in form of acid rain. The low temperature would not prevail long enough to cause the extinction.

Finally, the reading passage recommended that the extinction was caused by a asteroid strike. The speaker, while scientist hadn't find a asteroid crater of that period in any place where is possible to cause a global extinction with a asteroid strike. The nearest and most probable crater date back to millions years before the extinction that it hardly do contribution to the extinction.
