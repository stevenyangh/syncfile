The author of the article and speaker have a conflict of opinions about reason of the massive extinction at the end of triassic period. The article put foward 3 hypotheses to explain the mass-extinction, which are all refuted by the following lecture.

Firstly, the passage suggest that the fluctuating sea levels in that priode might be the reason for the massive scale extinction. The lecturer said that though the tempreture once declined, costal and shallow water eco-system are able to adapt the change of sea levels. Because the temprature was declining in a slow pace, which took about a million years. It is clear only a sudden change of sea levels could had killed so much species before any of them adapt to tje change. So that the lecturer thinks the mess-extinction is not caused by the decline of sea levels.

Second, the author propose that the vocanic activity are generally happening at the end of Triassic periode and spread accountant SO_2 into tje atmosphere, which would make air temprature significanrly decreased and simultenously extinct species who can't adapt, while most of the species at that point can't. The speaker questioned the explanation by the evidence that SO2 in air will soon combine with water and fell back to earth in form of acid rain. The low temprature would not previle long enough to cause the extinction.

Finally, the reading passage recommanded that the extinction was caused by a astroid strick. The speaker, while scientist hadn't find a astroid crater of that period in any place where is possible to cause a global extinction with a astroid strick. The nearest and most probable crater date back to millions years before the extinction that it hardly do contribution to the eztinction.
