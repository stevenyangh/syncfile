The author of the article and speaker have a conflict of opinions about what the curved stone balls found in scotland are. The article put foward 3 hypotheses to explain the usage of stones, which are all refuted by the following lecture.

Firstly, the passage suggest that curved stones are used as weapons. However, the lecturer view the issue from an opposite angle that those stones couldn't had been used as weapons. According to her, the defining evidence which supports her suggestion is that there are few fraction or broken piecies found on the curved stone balls, while stone made weapons like arrows and spears in that time alway have such signs of worn out. That fact proves the stones are not used as weapons because they are rarely used in rough ways.

Second, the author propose that the stones are used as standard of weight and measurement. However, the speaker opposed this claim by following exemplification that the stones balls have different weight because they are made of different material with different density, including sand stone, green stone and quartz. Thus, even though they are uniformed in size, still they couldn't become primative system of weight and measurement due to their uneven weight.

Finally, the reading passage recommanded that curved stones symbols social rankings or hold specified information of it's owner. By contrast, in according with the apeaker, the opinion of the author does not hold water. When it comes to stones have social purpose, the fact that only few of the stones are intricate, while others are too simple to mark class and identity of a ancient people. Besides, in scotland, people of high social ranking commonly buried with their personal possession when they died, while there is no curved stones found in the tombs of that time. If they have some social purpose, Not only should they had been seen as personal possession and found in those tombs, but also had complex symbols on its surface.
