\part{Coulomb's Law and Calculus on Vector Space}
the Coulomb's Law is simple. It shows the way electric charges interact with each other:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}
or we sometime write it as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=k\frac{qQ}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}
If $\mathbf{F}$ refers to the force added to charge A by charge B, $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ will be a unit ($|\mathbf{\hat{r}}| = 1$) vector point to charge A from charge B. However, directions are easy to decide if you take care of the + - stuff.


Our next goal is to discover the property of electric force. First, to make things easier, we will figure out a concept called electric field to skip a f**king test charge:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}
or we sometime write it as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}=k\frac{Q}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}
From the equtions, we have $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{E}q$. It's natural to form a concept of 'field' when the force is directly associated with location. While when such force do exactly the same work between 2 points no matter what route it travles through, and it is continous and differentiable on $R^3$, which means it is the gradient of a certain function. We call such function the potential function, while the gradient is the force.thus:
\phi
