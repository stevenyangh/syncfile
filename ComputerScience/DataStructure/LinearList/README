For link list and sequence list
the function may have the same name and same operation in human's perspective while act different in program.

ADT list {
  data:
    D={ a(i) | a(i) /belongto Elemset,i=1,2,3...n,n>=0}
  relation:
    R={ <a(i-1),a(i)> | a(i-1),a(i) /belongto D,i=1,2,3...,n}
  operation:
  initlist(&l)
    requirment: no
    consequnce: creat a empty list l
  destroylist(&l)   
    requirment: list l has already exist
    consequence: destroy list l
  clearlist(&l)   
    requirment: list l has already exist
    consequence: empty list l
  listlenth(l)   
    requirment: list l has already exist
    consequence: return the number of elements in list l
  getelem(l,i,&e)     
    requirment: list l has already exist while 1<=i<=listlenth(l)
    consequence: return value of the i th element in list l to variable e
  locateelem(l,e)
    requirment: list l has already exist
    consequence: find the element with the same value as e in list l and return its position
  listinsert(&l,i,e)
    requirment: list l has already exist while 1<=i<=listlenth(l)
    consequence: add e before the i th element in list l
  listdelete(&l,i,&e)
    requirment: list l has already exist while 1<=i<=listlenth(l)
    consequence: delete the i th element in the list l ,return its value to e while listlenth(l)-1
  traverselist(l)
    requirment:list l has already exist
    consequence: access every element in list l in order
}ADT list
